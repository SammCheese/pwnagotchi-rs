# Pwnagotchi-rs


Do you like pwnagotchi? Do you hate Python?

Awesome! Me too!

-----

This is a Work-in-Progress rewrite of Pwnagotchi in Rust.


It is unfinished, poorly Structured, does not include plugin nor display support (yet) and is broken/unimplemented in many parts.
The WebUI is also fairly ugly and partly not working yet.

I actually have no actual experience in Rust. This is a learning project for me so dont judge me for the poor execution or suboptimal implementations! ;D


Dependencies, Code and any API available WILL Rapidly change, refactor and/or get removed. Be warned!
